# Final Project - Data Science 479

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict loan defaults using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. By analyzing data on over 255,000 borrowers, including age, income, credit scores, and loan details, we aim to identify customers likely to default on loan repayments. This insight will enable banks to mitigate risks and offer proactive assistance to customers during the loan approval process.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes several key variables that can predict potential loan defaults:
- **Age**: Age of the borrower.
- **Income**: Monthly or annual income of the borrower.
- **Credit Scores**: Credit scores assigned by financial institutions.
- **Loan Details**: Details about loan amount, term, and interest rate.

## Repository Contents
- `data/`: Directory containing the raw and processed CSV and Excel files.
- `scripts/`: Analysis scripts used for data cleaning, processing, and modeling.
- `docs/`: Documentation related to data management and project findings.
- `backup/`: Backup copies of the dataset stored in the cloud.

## Data Management
Detailed below are the strategies employed for managing the dataset throughout this project:

### Data Collection Need
The data is utilized to spot customers who might be at risk of not fulfilling loan repayment terms.

### Data Sourcing
Data is sourced from Kaggleâ€™s Loan Default Prediction Challenge.

### Data Preparation and Quality Control
Data cleaning involves addressing missing values and removing outliers. Validations are performed to ensure the reliability of debt ratios and credit scores.

### Data Storage Solution
Data is stored in CSV format for analysis and SQL databases for robust querying capabilities. Processed data is maintained in both CSV and Excel formats.

### Data Backup
Data is backed up daily using local and cloud storage solutions, with version control managed through GitHub.

### Data Security and Privacy
Access is restricted to authorized team members. Data encryption is implemented to safeguard sensitive information.

### Data Retention and Maintenance
The dataset is maintained for long-term analysis, with regular updates and reviews to ensure its relevance and accuracy.

### Data Accessibility
Access to the dataset is managed based on individual roles and requirements, with sensitive information redacted for external sharing.

### Data Documentation and Publication
Comprehensive guides detail each dataset column and data relationships, serving as a resource for understanding and analyzing the dataset.
